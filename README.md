# MY PROFILE
**I am a graduate of the Makers Academy boot-camp** 
and this is the career change I've been dreaming of, having had a varied background including library services, video subtitling & a previous career in challenging but collaborative work assisting people with learning support needs to facilitate their learning, personal development and creativity.

**I am very keen to progress in a new career in coding** 
after how fulfilling the learning progress was with a Code Academy Ruby course, testing myself in Code Wars & working through Chris Pine's Learn To Program Book. This initial interest led me to joining the Makers course, where I discovered how involving it is to investigate & contribute to code solutions both independently & within a team through peer-programming.

**BUILDING MY KNOWLEDGE OF CODING FUNDAMENTALS**
- Since finishing the course phase I have been in the consolidation stage throughout a busy summer and feel I am building a solid grounding in understanding the fundamentals of planning & growing projects in Ruby and Javascript with all the related technology & TDD.

**ENTHUSIASM & COMMITMENT**
- I would describe myself as an enthusiastic and committed person who is very keen to learn and develop new skills in the coding field and learn continually from helpful 'errors' & know the joy of breaking through blockers and turning those testing colours from red to green. 

**LITERATE COMMUNICATOR**
- I am a gentle and easy-to-get-along-with person with excellent, literate communication skills & hope to develop those necessary skills within group projects to build well-designed & useful applications.

# THE MAKERS EXPERIENCE

`I completed the Makers Academy course in June 2022`

`I had previously completed Code Academy courses in Ruby, Javascript & started other follow-up courses to help the consolidation process including the Odin Project.`

In the course consolidation stage, I have been working to really embed my knowledge and get myself in a position to enter the job market to look for developer roles.

The Makers course helped me to learn with a lot of self-motivated research how to start constructing apps that fulfilled a given criteria from the ground up, from user stories using thorough planning & domain modelling.

------

- **RESEARCH** - I learnt how to research from a wealth of provided & self-sourced information, and shared those discoveries with others, learning how to differentiate & decipher the necessary methods to help with a project. 

- **COMMUNICATION** - I also drew on previous work experience to ensure the communication was clear within our pairing and project teams and assist in developing good working code with constant check-ins using Slack & Discord.

- **VISIBILITY** - I learned about following single responsibility principles to make our code clearer and to use debugging, following error messages & making visibility clearer to help the building process. 

- **PATIENCE** - Makers laid the groundwork for learning all the fundamentals of incremental full-stack development. I can draw on previous experience having worked with people with learning disabilities when gradually building their knowledge and skills through 'chaining' with patience and sensitivity, to not undermine their skills progress and feel building good code has similar parallels.

- **PERSISTENCE** - The course has also left me better equipped to discuss & disseminate from a wealth of information, to find specific methods that can contribute helpfully to projects and help drive a project along. I have the persistence from a previous career to keep trying different methods to find one that works better. While acknowledging this is a very new & challenging world I'm entering, I can't wait to get back to improving and committing more changes to previous & new projects and have to thank Makers for helping me make this major leap.

# MY SKILLS

`A long-term ability to deal with challenging situations within a time-frame`

- In many of my roles I've had to combine use of technology/catalogue systems within a variety of support situations. Often I've directed someone else or used technology myself to facilitate their development and achieved success in helping grow their knowledge & skills or to help them find a specific item. This supportive interaction has made me a very capable 'team player' and a good observer & listener in pair-programming, while under a time-constraint for a project but also have observed & understand the frustrations where the technology/apps provided don't quite meet the needs of users.

`Ability to be organised independently & coordinating within a team`

- I've had to be very organised in a lot of my roles, coordinating with a large group of staff while using software to help with organisation. This ability to coordinate and delegate has been within both team and solo situations, where I've had to be resourceful and work under my own motivation to make for a successful collaboration. This has helped me with coordinating with others during the course and with learning about incremental project building.

`Able to support and facilitate projects successfully, be adaptable and 'keep my cool'`

- Years of experience within previous education support & therapy roles, in challenging circumstance I learned to remain calm and focused on a task & in coordination with other team members, while helping those I supported achieve their learning/creative goals. I feel this has given me a firm grounding in working in new & challenging coding situations. During the course we were often grouped with others we hadn't worked with before & had to delegate working through a challenging project, using working styles & tech we hadn't used before and to achieve results quickly, while all being part of the creation of a working and visually satisfying, interactive end product that hopefully fulfilled the brief.

`What I hope I can bring to a coding/development situation`

**Patience/Communication/Coping with Blockers**

- Within the Makers course I learnt I can bring the skills of patience and good communication from previous work to a development situation and was able to work on sourcing information about methods that could help further that project and make valuable contributions. In the final project we had a significant obstacle with React on how to pull in API data from inputted postcodes, using state 'hooks', but I helped source a key nugget of information that helped progress beyond this major 'blocker'.

**Delegation/Agile Work/Resilience**

- I can also take delegation from other team members to focus on a particular aspect of a project and have a willingness to work on something that contributes usefully to team projects as a whole and within quick/agile time-scales. I hopefully showed I could be resilient & supportive and use agile principles to be able to move flexibly between roles and technology and to adapt to new tech' such as using REACT for the first time, but also to discuss and write an inclusive team methodology that made everyone feel supported and part of the success of a project from the outset.
