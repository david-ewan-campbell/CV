# INTRODUCTION

**I am a graduate of the Makers Academy boot-camp** 
& this is the career change I've been dreaming of. I had an enriching career in education learning support, which was challenging but collaborative & rewarding work, using technology as part of the process of assisting people with their learning support & education needs. I have also worked within the rigorous areas of video subtitling & library-cataloguing services.

**I am very excited to progress in a new career in coding** 
which I discovered after completing free courses during lock-down. This interest & passion to learn led me to joining the Makers remote course and discovering how much I enjoy investigating & contributing to code solutions both solo & in team situations.

-----------

# EXPERIENCE

- **Makers Academy**
I previously completed Code Academy courses in Ruby & Javascript & then delved deep into the full 
stack with Makers, started follow-up courses to help the consolidation process including Odin Project
Makers gave me grounding in the fundamentals of full-stack development.

In the course consolidation stage, I have been working to really embed my knowledge and get myself in a position to enter the job market to look for developer roles.

The Makers course helped me to learn with a lot of self-motivated research how to start constructing apps that fulfilled a given criteria from the ground up, from user stories using thorough planning & domain modelling.

------

- **DOMAIN MODELLING/MVC** – I learnt how to design projects from scratch from User Stories using 
modelling, using self-motivated & sharing research to complete projects, gradually learning to build 
the full stack with growing understanding of client-server relationships and the structure of the MVC.

- **AGILE WORKING** – I developed agile processes, learning to build a great interactive team experience to make the building of challenging projects more enjoyable and make everyone feel included and valued with an inclusive team charter, using collaborative online documents and peer-programming.

- **TEST DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT** - Building programs incrementally from rigorous TDD principles, learning to read error messages carefully, using debugging and gaining visibility on our process, learning to break down problems and work through each stage of development carefully a step at a time.

- **THE FULL STACK** - THE FULL STACK – A grounding in all levels of the stack, from fundamental methods building functions & classes using OOP with Ruby & Javascript, the front-end using HTML & CSS & interaction with the back using databases such as PostgresSQL & MongoDB.
