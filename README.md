## Personal Profile
I am a graduate of the Makers Academy bootcamp. I am very keen to progress in this new career in coding after discovering how involving it is to investigate & contribute to code solutions both independently & within a team through peer-programming.

After enjoying the progress I made on Code Academy and Code Wars, this initial interest led me to joining the Makers course & currently I am in the consolidation stage. I feel I am reaching a much more solid grounding in understanding the fundamentals of all aspects of the tech stack and am better equipped by the course to discuss & disseminate a wealth of information to find specific methods that can contribute helpfully to projects.

I would describe myself as an enthusiastic and committed person who is very keen to learn and develop new skills in the coding field and learn continually from 'errors' & know the joy of breaking through blockers and turning those testing colours from red to green. I am a gentle and relaxed person with good, literate communication skills & hope to develop those necessary skills within group projects to build well-designed & useful applications.

## Coding Experience

- **Completed Makers Academy course in June 2022 - currently in the consolidation phase & enjoying developing my understanding of all aspects of the stack..**

- **Previously completed Code Academy courses in Ruby and Javascript..**

- **Working through The Odin Project as part of the consolidation phase..**

- **Have achieved 169 mastery points on Codewars – 6 kyu in Ruby/7 kyu Javascript.**

The Makers course helped me to learn how to build apps that fulfilled a criteria from the ground up, from user stories via domain modelling. Then onto researching & learning to differentiate & decipher the necessary information to help with a project & how to communicate clearly within a team to assist in developing working code built from rigorous testing. While learning to make my own code more precise, following SRP in OOP & learning  rigorous principles of TDD, Makers has given me a broad introduction to all the fundamentals of full-stack development. I'm very keen to build on this process of developing secure, well-written code using incremental testing.

## Previous Work Experience (2001 - 2017)
I worked in varied education & additional support roles for children and adults with additional needs and arts/play space management in London, Brighton and Bath. I was responsible for the security & safe storage of information in secure computer databases about young people within government & Ofsted guidelines. My roles also included organising rotas, coordinating staff, ordering equipment online & organising activities for up to 40 plus children. I also acted as an educational support for people with additional needs, mainly in Maths, English & music therapies using computers & music technology in a variety of challenging situations.

## Skills

In many of my roles I've had to combine use of technology with a variety of difficult and challenging situations. This is while directing someone else to also use technology to facilitate their development and achieve success in helping grow their knowledge & skills. I've had to be very organised in a lot of my roles, coordinating with a wealth of staff and organising equipment & using computers in an organisational role. This ability to organise and delegate has also been within both team and solo situations where I've had to be resourceful and I feel I can achieve success with both.

I had years of experience in previous roles where I've had to remain calm in some difficult circumstances or just help people with technology and computers but while remaining calm and focused on a task but coordinating with others. I found this has given me a grounding in working in challenging coding situations within the course where a group of us who hadn't worked together before had to delegate to work through a challenging project using tech we had never used and to achieve success at all being part of the creation of a working and visually satisfying, interactive end product that hopefully fulfilled the brief.

Within the Makers course I've been able to show I can bring the skills of patience and good communication to a situation and be able to work on sourcing information about a method that could help further that project and make very valuable contributions to a successful project. I can also take delegation from other team members with a willingness to work on something that will contribute usefully to the team project as a whole

The resilience, calmness & flexibility learned from my previous work experience definitely saw me help in something like our final project. I hopefully showed I could be supportive and use agile principles to be able to move flexibly between roles and technology and to adapt to new technology such as using REACT.
